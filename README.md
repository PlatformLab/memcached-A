# Memcached and Memcached-A (Under Construction)

## Note
This repo contains two major branches:
the original memcached version 1.5.6 (`master` branch);
and the memcached-A (restructured memcached with Arachne, `memcached-A` branch).

The `coreTrace` branch adds timetraces and counters on memcached 1.5.6 to record
the changes of cores, time spent on libevent turnaround and network I/O, etc.

Memcached-A is currently under construction; the unit tests may be failing.
